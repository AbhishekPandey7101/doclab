       <h2>LIGHT</h2> 
       InÂ physics, the term "light" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.[4][5]Â In this sense,Â gamma rays,Â X-rays,Â microwavesÂ andÂ radio wavesÂ are also light. The primary properties of light areÂ intensity, propagation direction, frequency /recurrence/ repetition/regularity wavelengthÂ spectrumÂ andÂ polarization. ItsÂ speed in vacuum,Â 299792458Â m/s, is one of the fundamentalÂ constantsÂ of nature.[6]Â Like all types of the electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles that are calledÂ  as photonsÂ that represents theÂ quantaÂ of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as bothÂ waves and particles. The study of light, known asÂ optics, is an important research area inÂ modern physics.
The main source of natural light on Earth is theÂ Sun. Historically, another important source of light for humans has beenÂ fire, from ancient campfires to modernÂ kerosene lamps.With the development ofÂ electric lightsÂ andÂ power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight
        Light is radiation in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" target="_blank">electromagnetic waves </a> that make
    vision possible to the human eye.Electromagnetic radiation can be
    classified by its wavelength or frequency, as shown in Figure 1.1.

        <p>
            The wavelength of light is confined to a very narrow range limited by a short-wavelength edge between 360 and 400 nm (1 nm =
            10âˆ’6 mm; see Appendix I) and a long-wavelength edge between 760
            and 830 nm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared" target="_blank"> Infrared </a> radiation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet" target="_blank"> ultraviolet radiation </a>, which are
            not visible to human eye, are sometimes included in the category of
            light and referred to as infrared light and ultraviolet light. However,
            it is better to call these categories infrared radiation and ultraviolet
            radiation. When it is necessary to distinguish light from radiation
            not visible to human eye, it is referred to as visible light or visible
            radiation.

           <b> How white light is composed of several colored lights?</b>
          <span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span>

        <p>
            Newton (Figure 1.2) showed experimentally that white light, such
            as sunlight, is composed of various types of colored light. More
            specifically, he demonstrated the following facts by introducing
            sunlight into a prism (Figure 1.3). <br>
            1. White sunlight incident on a prism is separated into seven components differing in color, as observed in a rainbow. The seven
            colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (see
            Color Plate 1). <br>
            2. The spectrum (i.e., the seven components of light differing in
            color) can be reunited to give the original white light by focusing
            the components back through a reversed prism. <br>
            3. If one color component alone is incident on a prism, it cannot be
            further separated into the seven colors. <br>
            We now know that, when observed in detail, the spectrum
            includes an infinite range of components of different wavelengths
            that cannot all be given different color names. The classification
            into seven named components is based on a simple set of basic.

        color names. On detailed examination, other colors can be named.
    For example, reddish orange colors appear between the pure red
    and pure orange parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum" target="_blank"> spectrum.</a>
    Monochromatic light is light that cannot be separated into components.White light such as sunlight is polychromatic, i.e., amixture of
    monochromatic lights. A spectrum is a band of color observed when
    a beam of white light is separated into components of light that are
    arranged in the order of their wavelengths. The approximate correspondence between wavelengths and colors is shown in Figure 1.1.
    If one or more components is decreased in intensity and the
    components are recombined, colored light is obtained instead of
    the original white light. Thus, if an object illuminated with white
    light reflects the components with differing reflectance depending
    on the wavelengths, the human eye sees the object as colored. For
    example, a red object does not reflect much in the range from violet to yellow, but reflects the red component strongly. Thus, it is perceived to have a red color. In general, color is generated whenever
    white light is modified by reflection or transmission by an object.
