               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color" target="_blank"> Color</a> can be perceived by anyone as long as the person has sound
            eyesight. Nevertheless, most people find it extremely difficult to
            explain what ‘color’ is. A typical dictionary definition of color might
            be ‘a visual perception that enables one to differentiate otherwise
            identical objects by the intensity and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength" target="_blank"> wavelength of light’</a>. This
            is not a very satisfactory definition because it describes the physical stimulus that causes the perception rather than describing
            the perception itself. It would not be very helpful to someone who
            had never experienced color. Furthermore, the definition can lead
            to confusion because the word ‘color’ is also used to refer to the
            physical stimulus itself. In this book, we have accepted the common practice of using the word with both its meanings, but where
            we think there might be confusion, we have used the more explicit
            terms ‘perceived color’ and ‘color stimulus’.
