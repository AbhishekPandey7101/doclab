    <h2>  DEFINITION OF PHOTOMETRIC QUANTITIES </h2>
    In daily life, the term â€˜brightnessâ€™ is used without thinking carefully about its meaning. For instance, laser radiation is considered
â€˜brightâ€™, but its brightness is insufficient if it is to be used to illuminate a room. On the other hand, a few fluorescent lamps will
provide sufficient light for room illumination although, considered
as single lamps, they are not considered to be as â€˜brightâ€™ as lasers.
To explain this apparent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"> paradox </a>, the brightness of light must be
judged by a value normalized by solid angle or area, just as a substance is judged to be light or heavy by considering its mass per
unit volume, i.e., its density. Photometry comprises measuring the
â€˜brightnessâ€™ of lights and normalizing the measurements in various
ways to obtain photometric quantities. <br>

     <b>What are the elements that photometric quantities include?</b>

  <p>
    Photometric quantities include quantity of light, luminous flux,
luminous intensity, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminance"> illuminance </a>, luminous exitance, and luminance. <br> <br>

  <p>
    Luminous flux v is a quantity obtained by evaluating radiant flux e according to the luminous efficacy of the human eye.
    Quantity of light Qv is obtained by integrating the luminous flux
    over time and the other quantities are obtained by various geometric
    normalizations. <br>

  Thus, any photometric quantity can be obtained .
