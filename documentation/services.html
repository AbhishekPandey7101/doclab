    <h1>Services which color science professionals can provide</h1>
    <h2>Color Consultant</h2>
   
    <p> A color consultant combines color psychology, current trends, demographic statistics, and color design theories to come up with a successful informed solution. Add to that mix the science of visual and physiological effects – how color affects the human body – and you have a big picture of how color consultation works.</p>

    <h2>Fashion designers</h2>
   
    <p> Fashion designers incorporate a variety of color into their clothing and accessory designs. They may even center an entire collection around a color or group of hues, as they prepare pieces for the runway and/or retail. Fashion designers typically oversee the entire production process of their pieces and make decisions concerning the materials and embellishments for each piece. </p>
