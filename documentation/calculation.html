    <h2>CALCULATION AND MEASUREMENT OF
        PHOTOMETRIC QUANTITIES</h2>
        As described above, radiometric quantities can be converted into
photometric quantities and vice versa by the equation (photometric
quantity) = KÃ—(radiometric quantity). One lumen corresponds
by definition to 1/683 W of a monochromatic light of m = 555 nm,
which is the wavelength where V has its maximum value of unity.
Thus, Km , the maximum luminous efficacy of radiation for photopic
vision is 683 lm/W. In the case of scotopic vision, on the other hand,
V
 = 0.40175 at  = 555 nm as can be obtained by interpolating
the values in Table 1.1. For monochromatic light having a radiant
intensity of 1/683 W at  = 555 nm to yield a luminous flux of 1 lm
in scotopic vision, K
m, the maximum luminous efficacy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotopic_vision"target="_blank"></a> scotopic
vision must be set to 683/0.40175 = 1700 lm/W. This maximum
occurs at 
m = 507 nm. Thus, Equations 1.2a and 1.2b can be
written explicitly as

<section>Figure 1.21 shows the comparison between the spectral luminous efficacies K and K
     obtained through Figure 1.10 and
    Equations 1.15a and 1.15b. In general, photometric quantities for
    photopic vision are used more frequently than those for scotopic</section>

        vision. Accordingly, the following explanation is given using the
        symbols for photopic vision.
        In the above description, only <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-monochromatic-light"target="_blank"> monochromatic light </a>is treated.
        However, in daily life, monochromatic light is rare, and, in general,
        polychromatic light, such as sunlight or light emitted from an artifical lamp with a continuous or partly continuous polychromatic
        spectrum, is used. By finely dividing a polychromatic light as is
        shown . it can be considered to consist of a number
        of near-monochromatic components.
